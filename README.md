Predicting the size, location, and timing of natural hazards is virtually impossible, but now, earth scientists are able to forecast hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and landslides using fractals.
In the same way we can design a single device which can detect few of the natural calamities such as tornado,tsunami,earthquake
The device is constructed using different kinds of sensors for different type of calamity.
 This is a kind of personal device which can be used by each individual .
 Alerts are given either through signals or through voice.
 the voice is produced by the software developed which get information from the sensors (these sensors will be of different kinds like one sensor for detecting one type of calamity)the detector has a light also.for each different calamity different light is produced based on the light produced the software produces the voice
 It is handy and can be used anywhere.
